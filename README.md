`Tech Stack`

- Dfinity ICP Application
- written in Motoko and HTML5 / CSS / JS
- for VR, Desktop and Mobile (cross play)
- using three.js for 3D Rendering
- using Rapier as Physics Engine
- using peer.js for P2P communication
- using esprima for custom code
- written with assistance from Grok

`Current Functionality`

- Loads the environment, list of entities and program code from the local/network node
- Caches data of nodes with hash, loads data from cache if hash stayed the same
- Subscribes to other entities via WebRTC to stream their position, movement, etc.
- Broadcasts own location, movement, etc. at WebRTC address deposited in the node
- Renders the view of the environment and entities, animated with program code
- Reacts to basic gestures from the user provides menu options Basic User Interface

`Future Roadmap`

- In-World Chat and VoiceChat (Global / Channel / Single)
- Inventory, Items and Scarcity mechanisms for RPG economy
- Radar for Interaction Points
- Friendlist with direct calling, messaging and data sharing
- Better Avatar and visibility management
- Automate user movement & gestures with pre recorded macros
- Better Interface for Node and TreeHouse management, allow external asset sources
- Wallet to pay for all expenses in Otherland and to receive donations
- Convert glTF, obj, 3ds and other file formats to glb in App
- NPCs controlled by LLMs through APIs (custom)

`Setup IDE`

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install 
- Install WSL (ubuntu)
- Install VS Code (start in WSL mode!)
- Install nvm, node.js, npm, mops, dfx
- Clone Git Repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run mops:setup`  (installs Motoko 1.14 via mops; required for `mo:core` 2.6)
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (dfx will fill canister IDs on deploy)
- `dfx start --background --clean`
- Prefer `npm run deploy` (sets `DFX_MOC_PATH` to the moc pinned in `mops.toml`). Plain `dfx deploy` uses dfx 0.31's bundled moc 1.1, which cannot compile `mo:core` 2.6.
- If deploy prints `Pinned moc is not executable: moc-wrapper`, remove `export DFX_MOC_PATH=moc-wrapper` from `~/.bashrc` (or the current shell). That value came from `mops toolchain init`, which mops 3 removed. `npm run deploy` resolves the compiler from `mops toolchain bin moc` instead.

If you see `actorOfPrincipal does not exist` while building Motoko, dfx is using its bundled moc 1.1 instead of the mops toolchain. Fix with:
```bash
npm run mops:setup
npm run deploy
```

`Reset Network`

'dfx stop' (or 'dfx --killall' if needed)
'rm -rf .dfx' (if internet identity anchors fail)
'dfx start --background --clean'
'npm run deploy'
