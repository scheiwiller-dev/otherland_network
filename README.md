`Current Functionality`

Loads the environment, list of entities and program code from the local/network node \
Caches data of nodes with hash, loads data from cache if hash stayed the same \
Subscribes to other entities via WebRTC to stream their position, movement, etc. \
Broadcasts own location, movement, etc. at WebRTC address deposited in the node \
Renders the view of the environment and entities, animated with program code \
Reacts to basic gestures from the user provides menu options Basic User Interface

`Future Roadmap`

Implementing functionality to placeholdes UI areas:
- Chat (World / Group / Single)
- Friends list
- Mini Map
- Inventory
- Interaction Points \
Keeping a contact list with direct calling, messaging and data sharing \
Reduce own visibility further, no presence marker, only register in the node \
Automate user movement & gestures with pre recorded macros \
Provides an Interface to the Otherland Network to manage own nodes, exchange data between own nodes/entities and personal computing space, etc. \
Serves as a wallet to pay for all expenses in Otherland and to receive payment \
Convert glTF, obj, 3ds and other file formats to glb in App \
